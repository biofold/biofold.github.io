      <strong>1. Summary of the project objectives<br></strong>
   	In this report we summarize the research activity performed by Dr. 
   	Emidio Capriotti during the returning phase of the Marie-Curie IOF 
   	at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University 
   	of Balearic Islands under the supervision of Dr. Jairo Rocha.<br>
	The main aims of our proposal are the following: <br><br>
	i. Study and characterization of the rate of evolution of Single 
	Nucleotide 	Polymorphisms and their effect in human disease.<br>
	ii. Study and characterization of the structural determinants of 
	human disease.<br>
	iii. Development of new general machine learning methods for disease 
	prediction.<br>
	iv. Development of disease-specific predictors. <br>
	v. Development of a World Wide Web server for predicting the likelihood 
	of a SNP variant to be associated with human disease.<br><br>
	These 5 aims correspond to 6 different tasks that have to be accomplished 
	in 36 months. In the proposal's timeline, during the returning phase (12 months), 
	we planned to perform the two final 2 tasks. According to this, we mainly accomplished 
	the 4th and 5th. In conclusion during the whole period of the project (36 months) we 
	achieved all the five objectives described in our proposal.<br><br>
	  <strong>2. Description of the work performed since the beginning of the 	
	  project</strong><br>
	During the last 12 months of the project Dr. Emidio Capriotti developed a 
	new methods for the prediction of disease-specific mutations focusing on cancer. 
	In addition, he implemented two different web servers for the predictions of 
	disease-related variants. 
	In details EC selected a manually curated set cancer driver missense Single Nucleotide 
	Variants (mSNVs). This dataset previously used to train another method (Carter at al, 
	Cancer Research 2009) and analyzed it performing sequence analysis of the protein under 
	mutation. For each protein the sequence profile has been calculated using similar protein retrieved using the BLAST algorithm. Using all sequence information previously calculated 
	EC developed a machine learning approach to discriminate between cancer causing and neutral 
	variants. For this particular task only sequence information has been used because the 
	number of cancer mutations for which protein three-dimensional structure was available 
	were not enough abundant to train a machine learning method. Finally, EC implemented two 
	web servers: the first one more general for the prediction of disease-related mSNVs and the 
	second one more specific for the detection of cancer causing mSNVs.
 <br><br>
	  <strong>3. Description of the achieved results</strong><br>
	The research activity performed during the returning phase reached all the aims 
	described in our proposal. In particular, it has been demonstrated that for diseases 
	for which a good number of annotated mutations are available it is possible to build 
	disease-specific predictors. In particular we tested this hypothesis in the case of 
	cancer-causing mSNVs showing that the disease-specific methods reaches performs better 
	than the general method. In addition we implemented web available version of the method 
	that can be used by the scientific community to evaluate possible deleterious mutations 
	in human.<br><br>
	  <strong>4. Expected final results and their potential impact</strong><br>
	At the end of the returning phase we have developed a user-friendly web server interface 
	for the prediction of the effect of mSNVs. The implemented web tools include a general 
	method for the detection of disease-related variants that uses both protein sequence and 
	structure information and a cancer specific algorithm that takes in to account only sequence information. In conclusion we demonstrated that structural information is important to improvement 
	the prediction of deleterious variants. When structural information is not available but a 
	good set of mutations have been annotated, the function information are important to improve 
	the performance of the predictors on a specific class of diseases. We believe that in the 
	near future, when more mSNVs data will be available, the development of disease-specific 
	methods will be key strategy for the development of more accurate algorithms and for the 
	understanding of the disease mechanism. <br><br>

        During the last year in the returning phase the last two aims of the project 
        have been accomplished. These objectives correspond to the last two tasks. 
        More in details a set of manually curated driver cancer variants have been selected 
        and analyzed considering the evolutive information derived from a set of related sequences
        retrieved by BLAST algorithm. In addition, the analysis of the functional information 
        using a subset of reduced Gene Ontology terms (GO slim) has been used to characterize 
        particular functions that are more frequent in proteins related to cancer. With this 
        work we successfully accomplished the 4th aim of our proposal developing a Support Vector 
        Machine based method able to discriminate between cancer driving mSNVs and neutral 
        polymorphisms. In the last period of the grant EC accomplished the 5th objective of the
        Mut2Dis project developing different web servers for the prediction of the impact of 
        deleterious mutations.

      <strong>1. Progress towards objectives and details for each task </strong><br>
      In this section we summarized the objectives achieved for each
      one of the last two aims described in our proposal during the outgoing phase 
      at the University of Balearic Islands.    <br><br>
	1.1 Development of disease-specific predictors.<br>
	For the accomplishment of the 5<small><sup>th</sup></small> task, EC started in the last part of the outgoing 
	phase collecting cancer related mSNVs selecting only mutations with disease names
	associated to the MESH term ?neoplasm?. During the returning phase the previous set 
	was compared with a manually curated dataset of cancer driver mutations to select a 
	set of cancer-causing mutations and remove possible passenger cancer mSNVs not directly 
	cause of the pathological state.
	Using these data, EC analyzed compared the sequence profile in the mutated position for 
	the set of cancer-causing mutations and an equal set of mSNVs in SwissVar that are not 
	associated to any diseases that have been used as negative set. In the next step the frequency 
	particular class of protein function in the subset of cancer-causing mutations has been compared 
	with similar set of randomly selected disease-related mSNVs not associated to cancer. Finally most 	
	discriminative features has been selected and used to train and test a binary classifier 
	able to discriminate between cancer-causing and non cancer-causing mSNVs. 
 
<br><br>
	1.2 World Wide Web server for the disease-related mutation prediction.<br>
	During the last period of the returning phase, to accomplish the 6th task, 
	EC implemented different web servers to make available to the scientific 
	community the methods developed in this project. In detail, EC implemented 
	an updated version of the SNPs&GO algorithm that predicts the effect of mSNVs 
	using only sequence information. According to the findings of this research activity 
	a new version of the SNPs&GO algorithm that takes in to account protein structure 
	information (SNPs&GO<small><sup>3d</sup></small>) has been made available on the web. SNPs&GO server and its 
	implementation based on protein three-dimensional structure is reachable at
    <a href="http://snps.uib.es/snps-and-go" target=blank>http://snps.uib.es/snps-and-go</a>. 
	The promising results obtained in the analysis of cancer driver mutations have been used 
	to implement a web server for predicting the cancer causing mSNVs (Dr. Cancer).  
	The Dr Cancer web server is available at 
	<a href="http://snps.uib.es/drcancer" target=blank>http://snps.uib.es/drcancer</a>.<br><br>

	<strong>2. Researcher training activities/transfer of knowledge 
	activities/integration activities</strong><br>
	In the period of the returning phase at University of Balearic Islands, EC was contracted
	researcher in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. EC attended the Bologna 
	Winter School 2012, a 5-day course dedicate to the study of the proteins and their variants 
	from the structural and functional point of view.  He also had the opportunity to attend the 
	course of Optimization held by Dr Jairo Rocha. There has been also the opportunity of 
	collaboration with other members Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Research Group 
	to perform a statistical analysis for the detection of high discriminative sequence and 
	structure based feature included in our algorithms. <br><br>
	<strong>3. Highlight significant results</strong><br>
	During the second phase, EC achieved many significant results related to the main aims 
	of the Mut2Dis project. First of all, EC analyzed large dataset of cancer-causing mSNVs 
	evaluating evolutionary and functional information to discriminate them from neutral 
	polymorphisms and other disease-related mutations. The results have shown that residue 
	conservation in the mutated site from the protein sequence profile is one the best discriminative
	features. This finding has been also verified also comparing subset of cancer-causing mSNVs 
	and polymorphisms. We have also shown that cancer-specific GO scores are more accurate 
	that general GO-term ones in the identification of cancer-related protein, improving the
	detection of cancer-causing mSNVs. Finally, the new version SNPs&GO algorithm resulting 
	from this research project has been scored between the best in its category either in testes 
	performed by other groups (Thusberg et al. Human Mutation 2011) and in the blind set of 
	mutations on CHK2 released by the Critical Assessment for Genome Interpretation (CAGI) 
	organizers during the last two editions. 
	The great interest of the international scientific community on our methods is shown 
	from the geographic (<a href="http://snps.uib.es/" target=blank>http://snps.uib.es/</a>) 
	and the numeric 
	(<a href="http://snps.uib.es/awstats/awstats.pl" target=blank>http://snps.uib.es/awstats/awstats.p</a>) 
	representations of the access to the <a href="http://snps.uib.es/" target=blank>http://snps.uib.es/</a> 
	web server during the last few years. <br><br>
	<strong>4.	Statement on the use of resources</strong><br>
	For the development of this project during the returning phase the University of 
	Balearic Island had total expenses for 64,976.67 ? (see table in the attached file).
