#DATASETS FOR SCORING DDG PREDICTION METHODS


1) VB1432:    1432 variants from 79 protein structures corresponding to 65 clusters.
              9 mutations are have double experimental data. 1 mutation is not mapping
              to the strcuture. The 1LRP structure was replace with 1LMB. For structure 1WQ5
              was considered the chain B. Data from PMID:29597263.
2) S2648:     2648 variants from 132 protein strcutures corresponding to 113 clusters.
              Experimental DDGs of the same variants are avereged. Data from PMID:21569468.
3) Ssym:      634 variants from 357 structures corresponding to 13 clusters:
              Dataset composed by 342 mutations and their reverse. Data from PMID:29718106.
5) Broom:     Dataset composed by 605 mutations from 58 structures corresponding to 50 clusters.
              This dataset contains 53 mutations from non-native proteins and 59 mutations
              referring to fragment of the protein. Data from PMID:28710274.
4) Myoglobin: 134 variants from myoglobin from structure 1BZ6. Data from PMID:26054434
5) P53:       42 variants from P53 structure 2OCJ. Data from PMID:24281696.
