Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important source of human
 	      genome variability. The non-synonymous SNPs occurring in coding regions
 	      resulting in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) may affect protein 
 	      function and lead to pathology. We are interested to study the 
 	      relationship between mutation and disease to develop machine learning 
 	      methods for the prediction of disease-related SAPs. 
 	      The input features of our methods are sequence, evolutive and functional
 	      information. We have implemented <a target=blank
        href="http://gpcr2.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/PhD-SNP/PhD-SNP.cgi">PhD-SNP</a>, a simple method based on 
 	      protein sequence and profile data. Recently, in 
 	      <a target=blank href="http://snps-and-go.biocomp.unibo.it/"> SNPs&GO</a>, we improved the accuracy
 	      of the detection of disease-related SAPs including protein functional 
 	      information. All the predictors has been tested using a cross-validation
 	      procedure on a set of annotated SAPs selected from <a target=blank

     Protein Folding Stability and Kinetics </h4>

          <p class="text">Protein folding is a complex process that is responsible for the formation 
            of the protein tree-dimensional structure. In our work we study the protein
            folding focusing on two main aspects: the protein stability and the folding     
            kinetics. We are interested to predict the effect of single point protein 
            mutation on protein stability. To measure the effect of the mutation, we 
            use the variation of the free energy change (ddG) upon mutation that can be
            calculated as the difference of the free energy variation (dG) for the 
            mutant and the wild-type proteins. If we consider the unfolding free 
            energy we 
            have that more stable mutations correspond to positive ddG values and less
            stable mutants to negative ddG. In the 2004 we developed 
            <a target=blank href="http://gpcr2.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/I-Mutant/I-Mutant.cgi">I-Mutant</a> 
            a neural network binary classification method to predict if a mutation 
            increase or decrease the protein stability using protein structure.
            In the 2005 the second version of the program 
            <a target=blank href="http://gpcr2.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/I-Mutant2.0/I-Mutant2.0.cgi">I-Mutant2.0</a> has been 
            implemented to predict ddG value using only sequence information. 
            All this methods has been tested using a cross-validation procedure on
            a set of ddG values extracted from 
            <a target=blank href="http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/Protherm/protherm.html">
              Protherm </a>database.
            Currently a new version of the tool is under development.<br> 
            We are also interested in the understanding of protein folding kinetics. 
            In general proteins can have two-state kinetics when they folds directly 
            to the native state from the unfolded state or multi-state kinetics when 
            the protein folds through at least one intermediate state. The folding 
            rate describes how fast the folding process is and is related to the 
            activation energy of the process. In the 2007, 
            <a target=blank href="http://gpcr2.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/K-Fold/K-Fold.cgi">
              K-Fold</a> tools has been developed to predict
            the folding kinetics and rate of a given protein using structural 
            information.<br>

        <p class="text">The structure of biologically relevant macromolecules such as protein and
          RNA is important to understand their function. According to this hypothesis
          the structure is important to infer the function. Our group
           is developing methods for structural alignment to 
          extract common feature between different molecules and use them to predict
          unknown structure. In the 2008 
          <a target=blank href="http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/SARA/">
            SARA</a> algorithm has been implemented to align RNA tree-dimensional 
          structures. A new pipeline using SARA program has been used to assign
          RNA function using structure similarity.<br>
          In collaboration with Marc Marti Renom at the
          <a target=blank href="http://sgt.cnag.cat/">CNAG</a>, Barcelona 
          (Spain) we are implementing 
          a statistical potential to score RNA structures and to select near 
          native ones. We are also interested to develop new methods for RNA
          structure prediction.     </p>
